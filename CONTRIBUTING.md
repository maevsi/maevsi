## Guidelines

### Git & GitHub

To get started with open-source contributions and to ensure a structured approach, check out [@dargmuesli's Contributing Guidelines](https://gist.github.com/dargmuesli/430b7d902a22df02d88d1969a22a81b5#contribution-workflow).

### Semantic Versioning

Read [@dargmuesli's guide on Semantic Versioning](https://gist.github.com/dargmuesli/430b7d902a22df02d88d1969a22a81b5#file-semantic-versioning-md) to find out how to correctly format pull request, issue and commit titles and how this necessity speeds up our development.

### Vue

To allow you and other developers to quickly navigate through Vue Single-File Components many `pages` and `components` in this repository share a common structure in `script setup` that's inspired by [Vue's Options API](https://vueschool.io/articles/vuejs-tutorials/options-api-vs-composition-api/).
Such structure should be migrated to use [`composable`s](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/composables) as explained in [this video by Alexander Lichter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKaDFAxzJyw).

1. import-like and meta elements have to be added first without preceding comments
    1. `import`: like `import { x } from 'y'`
    1. `definePageMeta`
    1. `use`: like `const { x } = useNuxtApp()`

1. below, elements that define the data structure of a component **require separation by comments**
    1. `// refs`: like `const x = ref<HTMLElement>()`
    1. `// api data`: like `const x = useXMutation()`
    1. `// data`: like `const x = ref(...)`
    1. `// computations`: like `const x = computed(() => y)`
    1. `// vuelidate`: rules and `const v$ = useVuelidate(rules, form)`
    1. `// methods`: use `const x = () => ...` instead of `function x() {...}`
    1. `// lifecycle`: like `onMounted()`, `watch()`, ... (in that order)
    1. `// initialization`: like `init()`, `useHeadDefault()`, ... (in that order)

If you find yourself adding empty lines to a Vue component's template to add structure to it, you should extract the separated parts into individual components.

### Playwright

We use Playwright for end-to-end testing.
If your CI pipeline is failing because of incorrect test snapshots, `pnpm build` the application, update the snapshots using `pnpm test:e2e:docker:server:node:update` and commit the resulting changes if they match your expectation.

### Tailwind CSS

1. Use `flex` as spacing strategy, not `space-*` or `m-*` (except where it really doesn't make sense)
1. Use calculated utitily values like `border-2` or variable values over hardcoded values as in `border-[0.1px]` (except where it really doesn't make sense)

### TypeScript

1. Use `const` to define variables, not `let` (except where it really doesn't make sense)
